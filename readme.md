# WEBEASE

This is a personal project of mine made just for my own pleasure. 
I really like to code :)

Here is some word on the coding style

- Functions and variables are written as 'this_is_a_function' and 'this_is_a_variable'
- All functions that are called from events starts with a 'on_' as in 'on_selected()'
- Classes are not used

# Content

The important part is whats in the content. A page consist of a number of 'articles' which
then can hold one or more 'sections'

# Article
An article is more or less a container for a number of sections

# Section
A section can be of different types.

- Text: Normal text with formatting for 'Bold', 'Italic' and 'Mark'
- List: A unordered list
- Title: A title with some features
- Line: A simple horizontal line
- Image: Uploaded images of 'png', 'jpg' or 'jpeg' types
- Audio: Uploaded MP3 files
- Soundcloud: A Soundcloud song
- Spotify: A Spotify song
- Youtube: A Youtube video
- Empty: User as a distance item

# Themes
Colors and layout can be changed by using themes. There are system-themes that designs
the overall site.  The content of a page can however have its own theme which means that
the content of different pages can have their own design

# Users
The site can have any number of users which then can do different things depending on
their status.
